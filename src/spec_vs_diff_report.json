  "summary": "The diff adds a Valentine-themed React page with evasive No-button logic and a Yes success state, plus significant unrequested backend/auth/react-query scaffolding. The required static meme image asset under frontend/public/assets/generated is not present in the diff, and the App.tsx truncation prevents confirming some exact content (question text, button labels, and exact meme image usage).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Add the required generated image(s) as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and reference them directly from the frontend (do not fetch images from the backend).",
      "reason": "No file under frontend/public/assets/generated (e.g., valentine-good-choice-meme.dim_1024x1024.png) is shown as added in the diff, so the required static asset inclusion cannot be verified.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "When the user clicks \"Yes\", replace the prompt/buttons with a celebratory view that displays a meme image containing the text: \"Good choice\".",
      "reason": "The success-state portion of App.tsx is truncated before any <img> reference can be verified, and no static asset file is shown added; therefore the required meme image and its exact text cannot be confirmed from the diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Create a single-page romantic Valentine prompt UI that asks: \"Will you be my Valentine?\" and shows exactly two options: \"Yes\" and \"No\".",
      "reason": "App.tsx is truncated; the diff summary indicates a Valentine interactive component, but the exact on-load question text and the exact two button labels cannot be verified from the provided snippet.",

      "description": "Added Internet Identity authentication/provider flow (AuthClient, identity context) despite being a stated non-goal (no user accounts/auth).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest Non-goals include user accounts/authentication (including Internet Identity); diff adds an InternetIdentityProvider and related hook implementation and wraps the app with it.",

      "description": "Added react-query actor hook and backend actor creation logic, implying backend interaction scaffolding that is unnecessary for the requested static single-page interaction.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest says backend should remain unused unless strictly necessary; diff adds useActor hook that creates backend actors and invalidates/refetches queries.",

    {
      "description": "Added a lucide-react Heart icon dependency/usage for UI decoration.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest constraints say not to introduce other frameworks; while an icon library is not a framework, it is an unrequested new dependency/feature not mentioned in requirements.",
